## AgileREST

The AgileRest layer is a high available REST environment built on top of Mojolicious, 
a fantastic and modern Perl framework.

This layer is responsible to provide DB and IO server support for all authenticated clients.

The communication between Client and Server is performed via HTTP in a REST way.
 
This app runs on a pre-forking box, with multiple workers, which may be easily scalated.
 
Nginx is in front of the API end points working as load ballancer/proxy.
 
The AgileRest layer provides support for hot deploy of new REST end points.
 
The AgileRest layer provides automatic generated doc for each mapped server resource.
 
The AgileRest Layer does not servers static content, which is served via CDN / Nginx.
 
Each server resource is fully protected via HTTP authorizations and tokens
